The website will be able to do the following things:

Find all available study space

Check how busy a particular study space is

Book a study space for now (if this is allowed by the uni)

Track how busy study spaces are over time in order to make a pretty visulaisation, and also help predict how busy spaces are likely to be



Main point:

- Visualise study spaces.  


Data we can use:

- Computers which are used/available

- How many in the building (how full is building)

- Opening hours

- Different types of spaces

- Equipment available (computers, projecters, whiteboards, pianos)

- Which rooms are booked


What we can do:

- Book rooms in library using MyEd



TODO: 

Find out if we can book study space for 'now'
